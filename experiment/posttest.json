      "question": "In the simulation bench of the ring compression test, the ram speed of the die is:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "1mm/sec, 5mm/sec",
        "b": "1mm/sec, 2mm/sec",
        "c": "5mm/sec, 10mm/sec",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct — These speeds are commonly used in the simulation bench.",
        "b": "Incorrect — 2mm/sec is not used.",
        "c": "Incorrect — 10mm/sec not used.",
        "d": "Incorrect because (a) is correct."

      "question": "Which of the following may not be the friction between the specimen and the dies in the simulation bench of the ring compression test:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "0.05",
        "b": "0.4",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "0.05 is possible (low friction).",
        "b": "0.4 is possible (moderate friction).",
        "c": "Correct — 1.5 is unrealistic for metal forming friction.",

        "a": "Incorrect — No tension involved.",

        "a": "Correct — Standard ring used is OD=60mm, ID=30mm.",
