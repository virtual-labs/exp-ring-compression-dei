    "question": "Q1.The ring compression test is used to test:",
    "answers": {
      "a": "Friction condition of the billet and dies",
      "b": "The temperature variation in the billet",
      "c": "Surface hardness of the billet",
      "d": "None of the above"
    },
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Correct — The ring compression test is primarily used to determine friction between billet and dies.",
      "b": "Temperature variation is not measured in this test.",
      "c": "Surface hardness is not evaluated using RCT.",
      "d": "Incorrect because option (a) is correct."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "a",
    "difficulty": "easy"

  {
    "question": "Q2.The material used in the ring compression test is:",
    "answers": {
      "a": "Cylindrical plate",
      "b": "Hollow cylindrical plate",
      "c": "Square plate",
      "d": "None of the above"
    },
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Incorrect — RCT requires a ring, not a solid cylinder.",
      "b": "Correct — RCT uses a hollow ring specimen (OD–ID–Height).",
      "c": "Incorrect — Square plates are not used.",
      "d": "Incorrect because (b) is correct."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "b",
    "difficulty": "easy"

  {
    "question": "Q3.The good lubrication result in:",
    "answers": {
      "a": "Uniform increase of the internal and external diameter of the specimen",
      "b": "Decrease in external diameter and increase in internal diameter",
      "c": "Increase in external diameter and reduction in inner diameter",
      "d": "None of the above"
    },
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Incorrect — Not uniform change.",
      "b": "Correct — With good lubrication (low friction), ID increases while OD also increases.",
      "c": "Incorrect — Reduction in ID occurs in high friction.",
      "d": "Incorrect because (b) is correct."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "b",
    "difficulty": "medium"

  {
    "question": "Q4.In the virtual simulation video of the ring compression test, the specimen height is reduced to:",
    "answers": {
      "a": "50 percent",
      "b": "75 percent",
      "c": "Both",
      "d": "None of these"
    },
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Correct — The standard RCT reduces height to 50%.",
      "b": "75% reduction is not shown in the video.",
      "c": "Incorrect — Only 50% is used in standard simulation.",
      "d": "Incorrect because (a) is correct."

    "question": "Q5.In the simulation bench of the ring compression test, the material not used for the testing is:",
    "answers": {
      "a": "Copper",
      "b": "Aluminium",
      "c": "Steel",
      "d": "All of these"
    },
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Incorrect — Copper is used.",
      "b": "Incorrect — Aluminium is used.",
      "c": "Incorrect — Steel is used.",
      "d": "Correct — All three materials are used, so 'not used' = none, hence all options are included."
